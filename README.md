## Zen
Zen is a tool used for sending fake discord credentials or roblox cookies to a discord webhook. It was made using NextJS, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

I made this program mainly as a way to troll people who try to cookie log / token grab you. 

If you encounter any bugs, be sure to post about it in the issues tab!
