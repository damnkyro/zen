## Zen
Zen is a tool used for sending fake discord credentials or roblox cookies to a discord webhook. It was made using NextJS, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

I made this program mainly as a way to troll people who try to cookie log / token grab you. 

If you encounter any bugs, be sure to post about it in the issues tab!

## How to install
1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) intalled
2. Install the dependencies with the `npm install` command
3. Run `npm run dev` in the project folder
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Notes
I'll be remaking zen soon. This project currently feels bloated and there are also some errors with it. It also feels like overkill to use NextJS for it. Imma deliver soon tho, trust
